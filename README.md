# 👋 Hey, I'm Jack

**Blockchain Investigator | On-Chain Analyst | Social Engineering Specialist**

I combine deep blockchain forensics with psychological profiling and social engineering techniques to investigate fraud, manipulation, and criminal activity across crypto ecosystems.

---

## 🎯 What I Do

I specialize in **triangulated investigation** — a unique approach that merges three disciplines:

- 🔗 **On-Chain Analysis**: Deep diving into blockchain data to trace funds, identify entities, and detect patterns
- 🧠 **Psychological Profiling**: Understanding the cognitive biases and behavioral patterns of both attackers and victims
- 🕵️ **Social Engineering**: Active intelligence gathering through strategic interaction and infiltration

This combination allows me to not just track *what* happened, but understand *who* did it, *why*, and *where they'll strike next*.

## 🔬 Current Focus

### Memecoin Ecosystem Investigation

Currently researching the memecoin market dynamics, with focus on:
- Coordinated pump & dump schemes
- Alpha group manipulation tactics
- Rug pull patterns and serial scammer identification
- Psychological exploitation techniques (FOMO, authority bias, social proof)
- Tracking sophisticated traders and identifying market manipulation

### Key Research Areas:
- 📊 Behavioral analysis of top memecoin traders (identifying legitimate skill vs manipulation)
- 🎭 Infiltration and profiling of "alpha groups" and trading communities
- 🤖 Counter-scammer strategies (including anti-rugger methodologies)
- 🧩 Wallet clustering algorithms for linking multi-rug operations

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### On-Chain Investigation Tools
```
- Arkham Intelligence    → Entity identification & wallet labeling
- Cielo                  → Flow visualization & cross-chain tracking
- Dune Analytics         → Custom SQL queries & dashboards
- TRM Labs / Chainalysis → AML/CFT analysis & fund tracking
- Tenderly               → Transaction simulation & contract debugging
```

### Blockchain Coverage
- **EVM Chains**: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base...
- **Solana**: High-frequency memecoin activity
- **Bitcoin**: UTXO analysis & tracing
- **Multi-chain**: Cross-chain tracking & bridge analysis

### Development & Automation
- **Languages**: Rust, Python, Solidity
- **Specialization**: Trading bots, MEV strategies, blockchain monitoring

## 🤖 Bot Development Portfolio

I've built several sophisticated trading and monitoring systems in **Rust**:

### Sniper Bots
High-speed token launch snipers with <100ms execution time. Optimized for Solana and EVM chains with advanced mempool monitoring.

### MEV Extraction
Maximal Extractable Value bots for identifying and executing profitable arbitrage, liquidation, and sandwich opportunities for Rust.

### Anti-Rugger System
My most interesting project: a counter-scam system that:
- Profiles known rug pullers and tracks their wallet migrations
- Detects new token launches by identified scammers in real-time
- Front-runs the rugger's own rug pull (buying early, selling before they can exit)
- Uses behavioral clustering algorithms to link wallets across multiple operations

This bot effectively "rugs the rugger" by exploiting their predictable patterns.

## 🎓 Methodology

### Investigation Framework

My approach follows a five-phase process:

**1. Collect** (On-Chain)
- Transaction mapping and fund flow analysis
- Smart contract forensics
- Address clustering and entity identification

**2. Profile** (Psychology)
- Behavioral pattern analysis (timing, sophistication, risk tolerance)
- Attacker/victim typology classification
- Cognitive bias exploitation mapping

**3. Correlate** (Social Engineering)
- Cross-reference on-chain data with social footprints
- Active intelligence gathering through infiltration
- Timeline reconstruction with complete context

**4. Predict** (AI-Enhanced Analysis)
- Pattern recognition for future behavior prediction
- Probability modeling for next moves
- Vulnerability assessment

### Cognitive Biases I Track

Understanding psychology is key to both predicting scammer behavior and protecting victims:

| Bias | How Exploited | Investigation Use |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| FOMO | Artificial urgency, "limited time" | Detect coordinated timing patterns |
| Authority | Fake endorsements, hijacked verified accounts | Verify authentication chains |
| Social Proof | Bot farms, fake volume | Identify synthetic communities |
| Greed | Unrealistic yields | Analyze tokenomics sustainability |
| Loss Aversion | "Recover your funds" scams | Profile double-victim targeting |

## 📚 Research Interests

Beyond my current memecoin focus, I'm deeply interested in:

- **DeFi Protocol Security**: Flash loan attacks, oracle manipulation, reentrancy exploits
- **NFT Market Manipulation**: Wash trading, fake volume, coordinated pumps
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Exploits**: Attack vectors and fund recovery
- **Privacy Coins & Mixers**: Tracking through obfuscation layers (Tornado Cash, Aztec, etc.)
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Automated detection and exploitation pattern analysis
- **Whale Behavior Analysis**: Understanding market-moving actors
- **Exchange Manipulation**: Insider trading, listing manipulation, fake volume

## 🎯 Unique Value Proposition

**What makes my approach different:**

Most blockchain investigators focus purely on on-chain data. I add two critical layers:

1. **Psychological Profiling**: I don't just track funds — I understand the *person* behind the keyboard. Their patterns, vulnerabilities, ego markers, and probable next moves.

2. **Active Intelligence**: Rather than passive analysis, I use social engineering to gather intelligence directly from sources, infiltrate communities, and validate hypotheses.

This combination allows for **predictive investigation** rather than purely reactive analysis.
