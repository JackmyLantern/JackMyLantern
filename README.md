## 🎯 What I Do

I design and develop **psychologically-optimized betting and reward systems** for online platforms:

- **🎰 Casino & Betting Platforms** — Slots, table games, crash mechanics, live dealer integration
- **🎲 Prediction Markets** — Real-time odds engines, AMM-style liquidity, market resolution systems  
- **🎴 Gacha & Loot Systems** — Variable reward mechanics, pity systems, collection optimization
- **🔐 Provably Fair Systems** — Blockchain-integrated RNG, transparency layers, verifiable randomness
- **📊 Behavioral Analytics** — Retention mechanics, monetization funnels, player lifecycle optimization
- **💰 Payment Infrastructure** — Fiat & crypto integration, KYC/AML compliance, multi-currency support

I combine **neuroscience research** with **practical engineering** to build platforms that maximize engagement while maintaining transparency.

## 📊 Core Principles

**1. Data-Driven Design**  
Every mechanic is measured, tested, and iterated based on behavioral metrics.

**2. Psychological Precision**  
Understanding neuroscience (dopamine systems, variable ratio reinforcement, loss aversion) informs every design decision.

**3. Transparent Systems**  
Provably fair algorithms and clear odds build trust while maintaining house edge.

**4. Regulatory Awareness**  
Building within legal frameworks with proper compliance from day one.

**5. Iterative Development**  
Ship fast, measure everything, optimize continuously.

## 🎓 Research Background

Actively studying the intersection of:
- **Neuroscience** — Dopamine pathways, reward anticipation, addiction mechanisms
- **Behavioral Economics** — Cognitive biases, decision-making under uncertainty
- **Game Theory** — Nash equilibria, optimal strategies, mechanism design
- **Monetization Psychology** — Pricing strategies, value perception, whale optimization

Reading list includes academic papers from *Journal of Gambling Studies*, *Behavioral Neuroscience*, and industry analysis from *Deconstructor of Fun*.

## 📈 Philosophy

> "The best platforms aren't built on luck—they're built on understanding human behavior, optimizing incentive structures, and engineering engagement loops that create value for both users and operators."

I approach gambling and gacha development as a **design challenge**: how do you create compelling experiences that are psychologically engaging, mathematically sound, and ethically transparent?

The goal isn't just to build games—it's to understand *why* people play, *how* to optimize engagement, and *where* the industry is heading.

**Status:** Open to collaborations on innovative betting/gacha platforms. Let's build something engaging.
